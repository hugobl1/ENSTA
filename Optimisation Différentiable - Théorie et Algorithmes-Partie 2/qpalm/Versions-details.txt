Version 0.4 (September 2014)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Clarification in the stopping criterion: the semantics of
  'options.rctl' has changed a little.
  - If 'options.rctl' is set to 'constraint', the solver considers that
    the user of the solver knows that the QP is feasible and tries to
    realize feasibility. If it fails, it stops.
  - If 'options.rctl' is NOT set to 'constraint', the solver considers
    that the user does not know whether the QP is feasible. First it
    tries to realize feasibility. If it fails, instead of stopping (like
    in the case options.rctl == 'constraint'), it tries to realize
    feasibility of the CFQP.
- In qpalm_gp: clarification of the detectiion of nonconvexity and
  unboundedness, and beter computation of the initial curvature
  curv_init and initial stepsize.
- Possibility to do several successive GP phases (options.gp_succ =
  'mt') like in the MorÃ©-Toraldo proposal, which becomes the default
  option (with mt=1 in qpalm_alsp.m).

TODO
- Clarification in the update of the augmentation parameter: ...
- The options.rctl set to 'shifted_constraint' is now operational; it
  uses the ratio of the constraint changes to update the augmentation
  parameter.

Version 0.3 (July 2014)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- options.lslv deleted (CG is always assumed)
- The counter of total nb of GP iterations/phases info.gpit has been
  added.
- Possibility to use a solver-made diagonal preconditioner for the CG
  iterations, including for singular situations where the linear system
  to solve has a non trivial null space.
- Introduction of a solver-made (possibly singular) Cholesky
  preconditionner, which can detect direction of unboundedness.
- Better detection of unboundedness.

Version 0.2.3 (April 2014)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Spelling: hitten -> hit.
- Change of the computation of activity of inequality constraints, which
  is now done through an indicator vector II (values -1, 0, 1 for lower
  active, inactive and upper active bounds) from which WI and VI in
  qpalm_tcg are deduced.
- Change in the outputs.
- Avoiding computation and printings in case there is no bounds on x.
- All the reasons to break after a GP phase are now considered.
- The GP phase is successful if it makes a change in the activity of x
  and y (the latter was forgotten before).
- The bounds in x and y has been activated in a different manner and the
  activity is transmitted from one AL sunproblem to the other.
- The decision to update r is now based on rho_cn when
  stopping_test_on_c is true and on rho_scn otherwise (instead of taking
  always the min of the two quantites).
- lm on entry and return is now the vector of multipliers of length
  mi+me, associated with the inequality and equality constraints. There
  is no reason, indeed, to enter the multipliers associated with the
  bounds on x, which are not used.

Version 0.2.2 (April 2014)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The activity of the bound in x is now done using options.dxmin
  (instead of options.feas).
- The activity of the bound in y=AI*x is now done using the new
  options.dymin (instead of options.feas).

Version 0.2.1 (March 2014)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Correct treatment of the case when the starting point is solution
  (case of bound or inequality constraints).

Version 0.2 (December 2013)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Add the option 'dcrf', which is used to see whther the rounding errors
  prevail, preventing the stopping test from being realized.
- Add the option 'feass', tolerance for feasiblity of the closest
  feasible problem.
- The augmentation aprameter r is now set by using the minimum of the
  ratios |c|/|c-| and |sc|/|sc-|.

Version 0.1.1 (November 2013)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Remove the option 'gpph' which duplicated more or less the option
  'phase'.
- Cleaning the printings at all verbosity levels (there was a bug with
  verbosity level 2).

Version 0.1 (November 2013)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Number 238 for SVN on adt-minoqs.
- Introduction of the inequaliity constraints.
- Lower and upper bounds on x and AI have been seperated.
- Add the option 'gpph' which might be useful in developing the
  software.
- New test for detecting a direction of unboundedness.
- Both Armijo's and Goldstein's rules can be used in the linesearch of
  the GP phase.
